## Developer notes

- I published this application after only 1 week to quickly showcase my skills as a full stack developer for prospective clients, as I'm looking for a job at the time of writing.
- This is the first web app I created using TypeScript
- I made this app because I seriously needed to plan my weekly meals to avoid frequent fast foods
- If you can't think of any recipes at the time, you can add a store-bought / fast-food food as a replacement for the recipe inputs instead
- I plan to develop more features as time goes by, as listed above.
- Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests for any fixes you may find.
- Thank you to [Panlasang Pinoy](https://panlasangpinoy.com/) for sample recipes used in the test user.
